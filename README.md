### Built with: C#
### Game name: Mars
### Build status: 
Some errors are evident in the game. For example, the menu page. The menu page may have issues when player have pressed their desired option, e.g. 'Play'. The screen may just be a blank screen. Another error, they may not be able to move properly. The player camera script was working fine during the start of the project, however, at the final moment, the player camera just could not function as it should. Despite trying to solve this issue, the error still occurs. Another evident error would be the player may not be able to collect the required item. It was working fine at the beginning of the project, but then suddenly it could not work. Another issue, could not do a player inventory. Final error, could not allow users to place a special object in a specific location. Problem: Not sure how to code on that, allowing the player to place the special collectible somewhere.
### Code style:
Object oriented.
### Features done:
Designed a portal. This portal is accessible in the gameplay scene, 'SceneSample', which allows teleportation to the final scene.
Health bar.
Options menu: Volume slider
Background music
Collecting objects
### Some example of tests one could do to prove that the features work:
In the gameplay scene, one could walk to the end of the 'house', or exit it, and find an emissive light blue cube. This light blue cube is a portal, that would teleport the player to the final scene.
In the options menu, one could try to slide the volume.
To collect objects, one could try walking towards the firewood area, where there are 4 benches located outside of the house, in the gameplay scene. There is a special collectible item here, a gold key. Player can walk towards the key and observe if the item is being collected. If the key is no longer visible in the gameplay, it means player has successfully collected it.
